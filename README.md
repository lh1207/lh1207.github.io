This is the source code for my personal website, which showcases my portfolio and skills. You can visit the website at [lh1207.github.io](https://lh1207.github.io).

## How to Build

If you want to build the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lh1207/lh1207.github.io
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd lh1207.github.io
```

3. Install the necessary packages:
```bash
npm i
```

After these steps, you can start the local development server with `npm start` (if your project is set up this way).

Please note that you need to have Node.js 20.12.2 and npm installed on your machine to build the website
